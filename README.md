# Charity

Charity is an online platform designed to facilitate connections between charitable organizations and philanthropists. The primary goal of this project is to streamline the process of matching donors with existing needs, particularly those that require specific skills or expertise. By providing a systematic approach, Charity aims to effectively address non-monetary needs that demand specialized knowledge or abilities.

## Overview

Charitable organizations can define their needs as projects within the system. Philanthropists can then browse through these projects and submit requests to contribute their time and skills to those that align with their capabilities and availability. The defined projects include detailed descriptions and requirements, enabling philanthropists to search and find suitable opportunities based on their preferences.

Once a philanthropist expresses interest in a project, the corresponding charitable organization can review their profile and decide whether to accept or reject their request, considering their qualifications and conditions.

## Key Features

- **User Registration**: Both charitable organizations and philanthropists can create accounts and become members of the Charity platform.

- **Request Management**: Charitable organizations can review and accept or reject requests from philanthropists based on their suitability for the project.
